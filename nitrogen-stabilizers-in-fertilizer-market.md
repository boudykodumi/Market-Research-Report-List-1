<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Stabilizers in Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Urease Inhibitors</li><li>Nitrification Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen stabilizers in the fertilizer market enhance nitrogen efficiency by minimizing losses due to volatilization and leaching. Urease inhibitors, such as NBPT, prevent the conversion of urea into ammonia, reducing nitrogen loss through volatilization. Nitrification inhibitors, like DCD and DMPP, slow the microbial conversion of ammonium to nitrate, thus decreasing leaching and denitrification. These stabilizers improve nitrogen retention in soil, leading to better crop yields and reduced environmental impacts, making them increasingly popular among farmers seeking sustainable practices.</p></p>
