<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Displacement Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The linear displacement sensor market is categorized into two main types: contact and non-contact sensors. Contact type sensors require physical contact with the object being measured, providing accurate readings but potentially causing wear. They are often used in industrial applications. In contrast, non-contact type sensors measure displacement without physical contact, utilizing technologies like laser or ultrasonic waves. This type reduces wear and increases lifespan, making it suitable for delicate or moving applications. Both types serve critical roles in automation and precision measurement.</p></p>
