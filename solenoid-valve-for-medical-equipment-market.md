<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solenoid Valve for Medical Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting</li><li>Pilot Operated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the medical equipment market, solenoid valves are crucial for controlling fluid flow. Direct-acting solenoid valves are compact, using electromagnetic force to open or close the valve directly, making them suitable for low-pressure applications. Conversely, pilot-operated solenoid valves use a small pilot valve to control a larger main valve, enabling them to handle higher pressures and flow rates, typically used in larger medical devices. Both types play essential roles in ensuring precise fluid management in medical systems.</p></p>
