<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desiccant Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heated Dryer</li><li>Heatless Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desiccant dryer market primarily includes heated and heatless dryers. Heated dryers utilize external heat to enhance the desiccant's moisture absorption efficiency, providing lower dew points and faster regeneration cycles. Conversely, heatless dryers operate by using dry compressed air to regenerate the desiccant, making them energy-efficient since they don’t require external heat. Both types effectively control humidity levels in industrial applications, with choice depending on specific operational needs, energy costs, and desired performance characteristics.</p></p>
